    title: "About CASPR"
    body: "Configurable and Autonomous Sensor Processing Research (CASPR) is designed to enable effective onboard processing for next-generation sensors and applications.
           CASPR is a Department of Defense payload on the Space Test Program - Houston 7 (STP-H7) pallet aboard the International Space Station. 
           It was developed, designed, and built by the students and faculty of the NSF Center for Space, High-performance, and Resilient Computing at the University of Pittsburgh.
           Explore below to learn more about this exciting research testbed."
