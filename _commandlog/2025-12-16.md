After three years, eleven months, and four days of on-orbit operations, STP-H7-CASPR has been officially and permanently deactivated.  Tremendous success has been achieved, with tens of thousands of images captured, much data gathered, and many student research projects deployed!  We are very thankful to STP, SHREC members, and CASPR team members past and present!
